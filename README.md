# A discord bot

A port of my other bot [gobot](https://github.com/gdraynz/gobot) in python, a language I'm more confortable with.

## Features

* `!go played` shows your total game time
* `!go reminder` reminds you of something in some time

## To do

* Reminder management (list, delete)
* Gametime management (at least delete, + admin tool ?)
